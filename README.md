# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

In this project, we analyzed various datasets containing Amazon product reviews to determine the ratio of positive to non positive reviews between Vine and non-Vine users. Vine is a program where companies will pay various fees and even provide free products for consumers in return for positive website reviews. In order to determine if there is any bias towards favorable reviews from Vine members vs. non-members, we need to identify the percentage of 5 star ratings to total rating.  We utilized AWS , pgAdmin, and PySpark in order to effectively sort and transform our datasets. I selected the "sports" category as the sample for this project.
